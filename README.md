# Sample Efficient Imitation Learning

Algorithm implemented for my research project in https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05521

Key problem in imitation learning is sample efficiency and distribution shift; how to train an agent with samples from low coverage(distribution)/quantity data. It is a well known result that naive supervised learning based approaches(behavior cloning) has a compounding error problem. In this research, demonstrated that the convergence results of model-based adversarial learning approaches, as opposed to strictly supervised setting, indeed mitiagates the compounding problem both in theory and practice.
